# Console Game

Console game is a project that simulates a console view in your browser. It uses React for the frontend, and supabase for all backend activities and fetcherinoing. It will probably some day have some fun stuff you can do, who knows what I'll add to it. Right now it has a really scuff command system and log-in / sign up integration.
